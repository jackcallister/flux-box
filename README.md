Not much to see here. This is just a sand pit for developing iso-cool-morphic flux code. Hip.

The request comes in to node `node server.js` which returns a single string of html. Pretty dumb. The React app boots on the client and takes over from the browser rendered version.

It ain't pretty that's for sure.

Build process is rediculously over the top. Figuring out simple things like SASS are a pain. Even with webpack. I can't imagine using grunt and co.

Express is config, config, config.

I miss Rails.

Considering using Rails as a seperate front end stack but am unsure how that would line up with rendering React/Flux apps...
